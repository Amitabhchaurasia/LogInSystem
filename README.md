## :warning: Important Note 

Before getting started, please ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Spring Tool Suite 4](#) :computer:
- A compatible database for the backend services :floppy_disk:

For the database, no need to create tables manually; the system uses **ORM** :file_folder: (Object-Relational Mapping) for this purpose. By default, this backend uses **PostgreSQL** :elephant:, but you can configure it for another database if necessary. 


## :information_source: About

Welcome to the LogInSystem! :wave: This backend has been developed using **Spring Boot** :spring: to create APIs. It leverages **ORM**  for seamless database interactions and  regular expressions :1234: for data validation.
