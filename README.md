To use this backend, you must have `Spring Tool Suite 4`, 
and to run  backend services, you need to create a database no need to create table in database bczuse i used `ORM`. 
In this backend, PostgreSQL is used; to use another database, you
need to add all the necessary dependencies for that database in the 
`pom.xml` file for each service. Additionally, you need to configure
your database in the `application-dev.properties` file in each service.
The path to this file for each service is `src/main/resources`.
